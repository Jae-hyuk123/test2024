						Playing soccer provides numerous advantages, such as improving your strength, endurance and more. Get to know all the benefits that this beautiful game has on your mind and body. You might be surprised at some of the unexpected benefits of playing the most popular sport in the world
						
						You may be envious of soccer players being able to do bicycle kicks, but it's actually the running that's going to improve your endurance.

						Soccer is a team sport that revolves around running. Adults will cover up to 6 miles during a match. As well as having fun sending free kicks into the back of the net and tackling everything that gets past the halfway line, you'll benefit from an endurance boost. When done regularly, your matches and training sessions will make your cardio and breathing even stronger.‚Äç

					The benefits of soccer for your body
					Soccer trains all of your physical abilities. So stretch out, boost your speed and stay balanced.

					In soccer, you're not just playing with your feet! As with many team sports, you use all of your physical abilities. Whether you're diving to save goals or jumping for headers, you'll be stretching and working on your balance. Running and accelerating will train your speed, which is one of the keys to this sport. And playing a sport that doesn't use your hands will greatly improve your skill!
